bio: 'The creator of the first runet course on React Native. Actively advocating for the development of the Open Source community. He is an ardent supporter of the GraphQL API, and therefore an ardent hater of the REST API. I am sure that the line between front-end and back-end development has been erased thanks to products such as the Amazon AWS Amplify framework.
Looking for a middle ground between the teaching process and the benefits for students, therefore, experimenting with the creation of the course, a mobile application for hatching React Native developers in the React Native + GraphQL + AWS Amplify stack.'
