bio: 'The creator of the first runet course on React Native. Actively advocating for the development of the Open Source community. He is an ardent supporter of the GraphQL API, and therefore an ardent hater of the REST API. Be in opposition to TypeScript, replacing it with Flow, because it believes that the .ts extension splits the friendly and open world of JSniks into two camps and lingering holivars between them. He claims that not everything that is native is good! He sees the future in AR / VR with Oculus technology, so he does not think to invest his time in learning languages ​​for iOS and Android platforms. I am sure that the line between front-end and back-end development has been erased thanks to products such as the Amazon AWS Amplify framework.
Looking for a middle ground between the teaching process and the benefits for students, therefore, experimenting with the creation of the course, a mobile application for hatching React Native developers in the React Native + GraphQL + AWS Amplify stack.'
