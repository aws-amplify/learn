title: Rapid iOS App Prototyping with Amplify Admin UI and SwiftUI
description: "In this post, you will be using the Admin UI to prototype a room booking app that allows a user to sign in, view seeded available rooms, book one of those rooms, and see the bookings associated with that user. Since this is a prototype, we will be focusing on building the concept of the app and feign other features like authenticating the user and storing photos."
