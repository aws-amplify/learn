title: Developing and Implementing APIs at Scale, the Serverless Way
description: 'APIs are evolving and changing the way developers build. The technology stack you choose for the APIs that will power your applications need to ensure interoperability, scalability, reliability, security, performance and global reach. AWS offers a number of tools and services that can help not just in creating and operating the APIs, but also in building a community around them.'
