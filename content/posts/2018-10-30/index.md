title: Developing and Implementing APIs at Scale, the Serverless Way
description: 'APIs are evolving and changing the way developers build. Essential to any sort of application, they are driving our increasingly interactive and integrated software world. The technology stack you choose for the APIs that will power your applications need to ensure interoperability, scalability, reliability, security, performance and global reach to provide a great experience for both developers and customers. AWS Serverless Technologies inherently tick all of these boxes while removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting of maintaining and operating different types of application backends. AWS offers a number of tools and services that can help not just in creating and operating the APIs, but also in building a community around them.'
