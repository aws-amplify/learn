title: Build an Object Detection App Using Amazon Rekognition, Amplify, and SwiftUI
description: "There are many ways of integrating machine learning into an iOS app. Apple even offers Core ML to train our own models and get predictions that run on an iOS device. However, instead of worrying about training our own models and a lot of factors, there are cloud services that we can access easily to get the desired predictions. Amazon Rekognition is one of those cloud services making it easy to identify objects, text, and people, among other possibilities."
