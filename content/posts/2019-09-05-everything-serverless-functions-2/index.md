title: Everything Serverless Functions in AWS Amplify - Part 2
description: 'In the second video we go deeper with serverless functions being used as resolvers in AppSync. We take a look at accessing arguments being passed to the function, as well as how to access sibling data in the resolver and how to handle pagination. We did it all using the "amplify mock" command and running the environment locally.'
