description: "
Cloud computing has certainly changed the way we build, deploy and run our application workloads. No longer do we want to be in the business of waiting for infrastructure to be provisioned, configuring web and application servers, bouncing back and forth with networking teams about firewall rules and SSL certificates...and we haven't even written a line of code yet that delivers actual value to the business.
If this describes the way you still develop applications, then come along to this hands on workshop and learn how AWS Amplify is being used to modernise traditional web and mobile application development."
