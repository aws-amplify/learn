href: https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/amplify-your-web-and-mobile-application-development-with-cevo-and-aws-tickets-7670998663
description: "Cloud computing has changed the way we build, deploy and run our application workloads. No longer do we want to be waiting for infrastructure to be provisioned, configuring web and application servers, bouncing back and forth with networking teams...and we haven't even written a line of code yet.
If this describes the way you still develop applications, then come along to this hands on workshop and learn how AWS Amplify is being used to modernise traditional application development."
