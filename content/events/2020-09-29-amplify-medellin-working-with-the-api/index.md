title: Amplify Medell√≠n - Working with the API
description: 'In this event we will connect our react application to the API and then list products, we seek to make a typical example of a shopping cart where we can add selected items and then proceed to checkout. We will start by proposing a structure and a context of how our app should work and then we will talk about Graphql Queries, Mutations and Subscription.'
