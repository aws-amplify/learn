description: "Nader Dabit and Richard Threlkeld will be at React Europe hosting a workshop! In this workshop, we’ll start from scratch building a fully-featured cloud-enabled React application implementing features like user sign-up & sign-in, a managed GraphQL API with user authorization & fine-grained access control, image storage, & we’ll host the app on AWS. We’ll also learn how to implement & interact with serverless functions."
