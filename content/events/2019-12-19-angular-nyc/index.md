title: Angular NYC
description: "AngularNYC was created with the goal of sharing Angular knowledge and best-practices as well as providing a space where people can meet up and chat with others working with Angular. In this talk, we are going to build LNDBikes an app to find in real-time how many bikes are available so you and your friends are good to go and enjoy a great ride."
