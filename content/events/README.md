# Add an Event

Interested in hosting an Amplify meetup, or speaking about Amplify at a conference? We are here to support you with AWS credits, swag (free merch such as stickers and an Amplify hoodie!), and our events starter kit that includes a presentation deck, and a list of sample projects.

## Logistics

1. Send an email to aws-amplify-customer@amazon.com detailing the type of event you would like to host (e.g. meetup or speaker at a conference).
2. Fork this repo.
3. If you haven't already, add yourself as an [Amplify contributor](https://github.com/aws-amplify/community/tree/master/content/contributors).
4. Create a new folder in the repo for your event `/content/events/YYYY-MM-DD-desc`
5. Add an `index.md` to the folder as follows:

   ```
   ---
   title: AWS Summit London
   href: https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/london/
   description: "Learn about AWS Amplify at the AWS Summit."
   avatar: ./avatar.png
   attendantIds:
     - nader-dabit
   country: England
   city: London
   ---
   ```

6. Upload an image at the root of your event folder (e.g. `/content/events/YYYY-MM-DD-description/avatar.png`)

7. Submit a PR.

After we review the PR, we will add your event to our list of upcoming events.
