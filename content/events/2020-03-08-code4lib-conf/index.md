Code4Lib began as a simple mailing list in 2003 and held its first face-to-face meeting in 2005 in Chicago. The first official annual conference was held in 2006 in Corvallis, Oregon. Code4Lib is dedicated to being a diverse and inclusive community of technologists seeking to share ideas and build collaboration."
