title: React Europe
description: "React Europe is historically the place where many new industry standards in the React community are revealed to the world such as the first public demo of redux and time travel, the release of GraphQL, react native reanimated, mobx-state-tree and more.    

React Europe is the original European Conference since 2015 (second only to facebook's react conf worldwide) and we are excited to be back in May 2020 for our 6th edition with a new venue making it the biggest conference with up to 1500 attendees."
