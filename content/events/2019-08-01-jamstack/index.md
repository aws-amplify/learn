title: JAMStack Meetup
description: "'Building JAMstack Applications with Gatsby and AWS Amplify Framework'

In this presentation, Nader Dabit will show how to build custom JamStack APIs with GraphQL & serverless functions using Amplify & the Amplify CLI. We'll take a new Gatsby site, add a GraphQL backend, & then add serverless functions to dynamically fetch data. We'll also look at how to implement client-side authentication in a Gatsby site."
