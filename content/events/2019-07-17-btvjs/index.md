title: BTVJS Meetup
description: "Chris Frank will be at the Burlington Vermont JavaScript Meetup to host a workshop. In this workshop, we’ll start from scratch building a fully-featured cloud-enabled React Native iOS application, implementing features like user sign-up & sign-in, a managed GraphQL API with user authorization & fine-grained access control, image storage, & we’ll host the app on AWS. We’ll also learn how to implement & interact with serverless functions working with AWS Amplify and Expo."
