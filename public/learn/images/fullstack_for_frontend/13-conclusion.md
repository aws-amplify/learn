# Conclusion

You've now built a full application with authentication, authorization, data, and a React frontend built with AWS Amplify Studio.
## Next Steps

To test your skills and keep learning Amplify, you can add more features to this application, for example:
- Add images to your notes. Enable storage via Amplify Studio, then use the [Amplify JS Libraries](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/storage/getting-started/q/platform/js/) to access the images in your app.
- Turn your application into a Next.js app, then move some of your [backend logic to the server-side](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/ssr/q/platform/js/).
- Write logic and authorization rules so that notes can be shared between users (for ex. you could share a to do list with your significant other).
